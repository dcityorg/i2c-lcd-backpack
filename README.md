LCD character modules are widely available and are very reasonably priced. They come in many different sizes (16x1, 16x2, 20x2, 20x4, etc.) and in many different colors. Nearly all electronic suppliers sell them, and you can even get them on [Amazon](http://amazon.com) and [eBay](http://ebay.com). This project is small board that mounts to the back of these displays, and provides an easy to use I²C interface with Grove type connectors. This board will work with either 3.3 or 5 volt LCD modules.

A demo program and software library are available for Arduino and Particle microcontroller boards. This library has many functions to make using these displays easy.

Bare PC boards are available from OSH Park.
